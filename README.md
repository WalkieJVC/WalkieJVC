## About Me

Hello! I'm Juan, a recent software engineering graduate from the College of Southern Nevada. Proficient in Java and well-versed in Object-Oriented Programming, I'm eager to leverage my skills to contribute meaningfully to software development projects. I have hands-on experience with tools like Android Studio and Spring Boot. I am also proficient with Java and C# and I'm committed to continuous learning to further refine my abilities as a software engineer.
